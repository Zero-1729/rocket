Flesh out stellar

| - Get in final Tests and tweaks on parser, interpreter and scanner
.

Add support for post fix arithmetic ops:

n++; /// The same as 'n = n + 1;'
n-- ; /// The same as 'n = n - 1;'

Find hack for module "import":-

- Scan file provided after "import" then merge the envs of the interpreters. To allow all funcs, vars, classes to be available in the current file or REPL session. like C's #include <{libname}.h>

- Specially scan for all classes defined in the file. Providing some neat packaging for large projects.

- Create an importer class that parses rocket files to fill current global scope with all its defs ('funcs', 'classes', 'vars', 'consts', etc)
